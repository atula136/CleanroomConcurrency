/**
 A generic interface describing a lock that can be acquired for synchronous
 (blocking) reading or (potentially) asynchronous writing.
 
 `AsyncLock` differs from `Lock` by virtue of the fact that, in the case of
 the former, write operations _may_ (but are not _guaranteed_ to) be
 asynchronous, a trait that depends on the underlying implementation.

 Because of this possibility, the `write()` function accepts an escaping
 function.
