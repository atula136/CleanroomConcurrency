/**
 A generic interface describing a lock that can be acquired for synchronous
 (blocking) reading or potentially asynchronous writing.
 
 Because the write operations of a `FastWriteLock` _may_ be (but are not
 _guaranteed_ to be) performed asynchronously, unlike with the completely
 synchronous `Lock` protocol:

 - Write operations require an `@escaping` closure
 - A value cannot be returned from a write operation

 The underlying `FastWriteLock` implementation determines whether and when
 write operations are performed asynchronously.
