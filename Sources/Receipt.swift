 Represents a specific registrant within a specific `Registry`.
 
 A `Receipt` is given when an item is registered, and is used to manage the
 lifetime of item in the registry.
 
 When the `Receipt` is deallocated, the associated registrant is automatically
 de-registered. You can also call `deregister()` to force removal of the item
 prior to deallocation of its `Receipt`.
