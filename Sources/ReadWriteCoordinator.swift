/**
`ReadWriteCoordinator` instances can be used to coordinate access to a mutable
resource shared across multiple threads.

You can think of the `ReadWriteCoordinator` as a read/write lock having the
following properties:

    - The *read lock* allows any number of *readers* to execute concurrently.

    - The *write lock* allows one and only one *writer* to execute at a time.

    - As long as there is at least one reader executing, the write lock cannot be acquired.

    - As long as the write lock is held, no readers can execute.
