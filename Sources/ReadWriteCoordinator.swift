/**
 `ReadWriteCoordinator` instances can be used to coordinate access to a mutable
 resource shared across multiple threads.

 You can think of the `ReadWriteCoordinator` as a read/write lock having the
 following properties:

 - The *read lock* allows any number of *readers* to execute concurrently.

 - The *write lock* allows one and only one *writer* to execute at a time.

 - As long as there is at least one reader executing, the write lock cannot be acquired.

 - As long as the write lock is held, no readers can execute.
